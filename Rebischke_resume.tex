\bigskip
\begin{itemize}
\item Automated the TLS keypair deployment to a central firewall for inbound TLS inspection by writing a middleware in Python that pulls TLS keypairs and pushes them via REST-API to the firewall. The production environment had 4000 students and 1000 employees.
\item Achieved a relation of LDAP users and IP addresses for writing user/IP specific firewall rules via implementing
a REST API as middleware between a proprietary service, Freeradius and OpenVPN
\item Reduced toil of writing 2--25 mails daily via writing a software in Python that fetches IPS firewall alerts via REST API and mails them
to responsible system administrators in institutes.
\item Showed ownership by maintaining a Proxmox VE cluster consisting of 25 physical nodes.
\item Wrote a software that helps finding unused or orphaned artifacts in firewalls.
